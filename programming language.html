        <p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine
            code output.
            Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement
            algorithms.
            Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a
            set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages.
            The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and
            semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming
            language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant
            implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by
            a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

    <div class="Syntax">
        A programming language's surface form is known as its syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual;
        they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On
        the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature, using visual
        relationships between symbols to specify a program.

        The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct
        program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either formal or hard-coded in a
        reference implementation). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.
        Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions (for lexical
        structure) and Backusâ€“Naur form (for grammatical structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on Lisp:
        This grammar specifies the following:

        an expression is either an atom or a list;
        an atom is either a number or a symbol;
        a number is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;
        a symbol is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and
        a list is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more expressions inside it.

    <div id="Type system">
        <p>
            A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types, how it can
            manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a
            certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations.
            Any decidable type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also
            prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have
            type loopholes, usually unchecked casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally
            disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to type
            check programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, infer types, relieving the programmer
            from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as type
            theory.
            A language is typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is
            applicable.[46] For example, the data represented by "this text between the quotes" is a string, and in many
            programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed. The invalid
            operation may be detected when the program is compiled ("static" type checking) and will be rejected by the
            compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected while the program is running ("dynamic"
            type checking), resulting in a run-time exception. Many languages allow a function called an exception
            handler to handle this exception and, for example, always return "-1" as the result.

            Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for
            communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing language families of related
            languages branching one from another.[50][51] But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental
            ways from languages that have evolved through usage. A significant difference is that a programming language
            can be fully described and studied in its entirety since it has a precise and finite definition.[52] By
            contrast, natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities. While
            constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose,
            they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.

            Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with
            other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one
            "universal" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted
            as filling this role.[53] The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts
            in which languages are used:
            Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of
            programmers.
            Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else to experts who may be
            comfortable with considerable complexity.
            Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers to
            supercomputers.
            Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.
            Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing
            them in a particular language.
